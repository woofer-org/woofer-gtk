/*
 * This provides some functions to loopup graphical icons to use in the
 * application windows.  Both themed icons (fetched from the system files) as
 * well as static images pre-compiled into the executables are supported.
 *
 * Since this module only contains utilities for other modules, all of
 * these "utilities" are part of the normal module functions and
 * constructors, destructors, etc are left out.
